# Error Prone performance measurement project

Current test subject is [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) 2.x project (Apache 2.0)

I integrate [Error Prone](https://github.com/google/error-prone) with RxJava and provide ways to benchmark and profile builds with Error Prone, with slightly optimized Error Prone configuration and without Error Prone.

## Findings

Error Prone (2.2.0) seems to significantly slow down compilation comparing to JDK compiler. 

Initially this popped out while I was integrating Error Prone into our projects at Lyft and then was reproduced with very similar results on RxJava.

Quote from ["Building Useful Program Analysis Tools Using an Extensible Java Compiler"](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub38275.html) White Paper published by Research at Google in 2012:

>We found that error-prone incurs a 9.0% time overhead and  a  0.95%  memory  overhead,  which  are tolerable for our build environment. We have not yet invested effort in optimizing error-prone, and it should be possible to improve its performance.

I'm specifically interested in:

>9.0%  time  overhead and  a  0.95%  memory  overhead

and 

>We  have  not  yet  invested  effort  in optimizing error-prone, and it should be possible to improve its performance.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any other discussions of Error Prone performance (PRs welcome).

My benchmarks, profilings and real-world integration experience show that Error Prone (2.2.0) has much more significant overhead on build times, in some cases up to `3.51`x slower (see details below).

## Project Structure

- [`scripts/`](scripts/): scripts to ease benchmarking/profiling for you, they're **intended** to be used by you to achieve reproducible and comparable results
- [`scenarios/`](scenarios/): benchmark/profiling scenarios in format supported by [gradle-profiler](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler)
- [`docker/`](docker/): Dockerfiles and misc required for isolated benchmark/profile environment
- [`rxjava/`](rxjava/): project under test
- [`assets/`](assets/): benchmark/profiling files for README/etc
- `profile-out*/`: directories with benchmark/profiling results generated by `gradle-profiler`

To ease environment setup (specifically switching between JDK versions and building gradle-profiler) I've Dockerized project. 
However you still welcome to run profiling directly on local environment.

## How to reproduce results on your end

I recommend using `*-docker-*` scripts, as they don't require you to manage JDK and `gradle-profiler` installation. Moreover, Docker seems to reproducibly improve disk reads for these benchmarks (see [Docker WTH](#docker-wth-bonus-track)) which allows pretty much exclude IO from benchmarks and align final build times with compiler performance which is what we're interested in.

`*-local-*` scripts expect you to have `gradle-profiler` built and available in `PATH`, as well as JDK installed depending on requirements.

Notes on Docker:

>macOS can't run Docker on macOS kernel natively, thus it runs it through macOS virtualization. It has ridiculous IO overhead which can affect runs.
>
>Linux machine with minimal amount of processes running is recommended.

### Benchmarking

#### Benchmark Error Prone in RxJava project with Oracle JDK 8 in a Docker container

```console
scripts/benchmark-rxjava-docker-oracle-jdk8.sh
```

#### Benchmark Error Prone (replaces JDK's `javac`) in RxJava project in local environment

```console
scripts/benchmark-rxjava-local.sh
```

#### Benchmark Error Prone (as `javac` plugin) in RxJava project with Oracle JDK 9 in a Docker container

```console
scripts/benchmark-rxjava-docker-oracle-jdk9-javac-plugin.sh
```

#### Benchmark Error Prone (as `javac` plugin) in RxJava project in local environment

```console
scripts/benchmark-rxjava-local-javac-plugin.sh
```

### Profiling

Note 1:

>I personally use [JProfiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html), but it's a paid product and you need to have a license for it. It gives deep insigts into method calls, memory allocations and so on and I consider it the most useful tool for profiling in this project.
>I expect people interested in deep profiling data to use JProfiler or any other reasonable profiler of their choise (see Note 3).

Note 2:

>`chrome-trace` gives very limited profiling information, however it clearly shows java compilation step duration and it's free. 
>For some reason it doesn't work in provided Docker env, see [this issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler/issues/64) (PRs welcome).

Note 3:

>PRs with more profiler integrations are welcomed! Especially if they're open-source, free to use and provide method call analysis.

You can check `-*profile-*` scripts, copy/modify them and add profiler of your choice.

## Why this project exists

This project is made to provide reproducible, open-source setup to uncover real-world performance issues of Error Prone (2.2.0).

I was trying to integrate Error Prone in our Android project at Lyft and was surprised by `3.85x` slower build times which is obviously unnaceptable.

These findings were initially discussed in Buck Build system Slack, specifically with [@kageiit](https://github.com/kageiit) (a fellow build-engineer at Uber).

Obviously, guys from [Error Prone](https://github.com/google/error-prone) will want setup that'll allow them reproduce these results, so here it is :)

## Docker WTH (Bonus Track)

During Dockerization of this benchmarking/profiling setup I've noticed interesting thing:

>Running same benchmarks/profiling in Docker container results in much faster execution.

Reproduced on 2 different Linux machines.

>It does however produce stable results and I still recommend Docker for benchmarks and profiling as it removes hassle of environment setup.

### Why does this happen?

I don't have an accurate answer *yet*, only guesses.

Profiling clearly shows that disk reads are much faster in Docker container, they're fast like data is either in RAM or very well cached in RAM.

>Note that the way benchmark script is made is that it mounts project dir to the Docker container and then copies it inside container fs, so benchmark runs against files that are inside container fs.

Docker/Linux experts are very welcomed to reproduce it and update this section with explanaition and perf profiling + references to Docker docs/sources.

### How to reproduce "Docker WTH"

#### Local

>Note that you need Oracle JDK 8 and `gradle-profiler` installed, ideally same version as Docker image resolves.

```console
scripts/benchmark-rxjava-local-jdk8.sh
```

#### Docker

```console
scripts/benchmark-rxjava-docker-oracle-jdk8.sh
